Okay so I think for theme I want to do interactivity because I love the idea of a user interfacing with some sort of grand gesture of art. And in the context of what I want I think that art will be something like either a point and click game or a choose your adventure type of game. I'm to read soem of the online reading on interactivity and I'll browse the artists given to find one that will apply into my vision. What inspired this decision was seeing what other users had made in the Workshop task, specifically my classmates [Alice Lee](https://github.com/glovving/workshop-task-4) and [Sienna](https://github.com/siennabienna/workshop_4) and how they had interactive, reactionary little worlds, that really captivated me.

I am feeling quite down after seeing my grade for the workshops assignment, I am feeling a lot of emotions. I know that what I submitted wasn't the best work I could do, however I am sad that it didn't do very well as I was proud of myself for finishing it. I am grateful for Leo's feedback and I will be taking what he said on board. It might be worth looking into support for students with ADHD so I can both meet deadlines and also give a great effort into my working. I want to do better than this, because I want my grades to reflect the effort I put into this work.

> "The level of engagement with documentation is not consistent throughout the workshop tasks (some are more complete than others),and at times there was scope to draw on the full range of resources available to you (e.g. using RiTa's documentation for workshop 6, as well as or instead of DeepSeek). While it's good to see that you're finding DeepSeek helpful in providing solutions, as outlined on the assignment brief and in class, you need to provide full details of your engagement with this tool, including what you've learnt from the answers you've received. The README files made good use of headings, lists, links, and images. For the studio project, make sure to explain what you've learnt from generative AI tools if you use them, and try to use in-links and code extracts with syntax highlighting (see the example workshop 2 repository on the course GitHub account)".

This is Leo's feedback which I will be using as guidance for what improvements I can make for my documentation of my coding work. It's going to be helpful because I kniw what is going to give me bette odds at both getting a higher grade and making something that I feel proud of.

Remember to use [this](https://github.com/Elam-Fine-Arts-205/workshop-task-2-example) when I record code. Also use [Github Basic Writing](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code) and [p5.js Tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/)

### Moving On
What I am going to do today to get started on this first week of work is read the book on interactivity and write that refleaction out today. Then afterwards I will coem back here and say what ideas it inspired within me and then might start a plan for what direction my coding will will go in.

### Quotes from the chapter Interactive Art from the book [A Companion to Digital Art by Nathaniel Stern](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/9781118475249.ch13)
> "The interactivity of software‐based digital systems, on the other hand, is pre‐programmed. With few exceptions, it is a back and forth: “I do this and that happens.” There is a danger that we, as participants, are instrumentalized as interactors, and thus become less dynamic, rather than more so. Interaction becomes a game with a goal, and we must behave in a specific way to win it. Poorly conceived interactive art can force particular and thus predictive movements, which then may as well be static because our moving‐thinking‐feelings are pre‐formed".

- Trying to read that chapter on Interactive Art was really philosophical in that it makes lots of ideas and such but for a reader such as myself it's really overwhelming, some of it makes sense, and other parts are farely hard to understand, and that's not a jab at the author, but, I think, as someone who has previously never approached this type of digital artistic style and hasn't learnt about the theory before, it's not the easiest for someone trying to pick up for the first time. And all the ideas seem fine but it really feels quite bloated with too much jargon that goes in one ear and out the next. I think if you care about bringing forward and spreading concepts with people you need to make it understandable for most people. Now I understand that a book never has to be something that is universally understandable, just as every great work of artistic human expression, however I think the pieces that connect people and get people excited about ideas are the ones that don't really need to explain themselves several times. Like I understand if there was a word quota however some of it feels so devoid of human emotion, it makes the divide between digital and human feel wider because what I am reading isn't very moving or seems more interested about specifics than genuinely appreciating the artists and artworks being discussed. In my opinion, theory is a tool used to empower actions, motives, agency, and when it becomes the focal point it kind of takes away from the greatness of the piece. And I'm not saying that theory isn't incredible, I'm trying to say that theory should be championed through art and creativity of the artist. By writing and explaining everything, the wonder is gone, the thrill is gone, and completely, algorithmically digesting everything it has to offer no longer makes it an interesting subject. To me it seems like it's just gushing over seeing yourself on a screen and how that's not you on the screen that's the imaginary you and the shadow you make is just the perception of your body in the light, boring self-masturbatory nothingness.

- What I have really enjoyed actually seeing and understanding is the work and art of [Olia Lialina](https://art.teleportacia.org/#CenterOfTheUniverse) and how she uses the digital world to craft stories and intellegent scenes that don't overstay their welcome. This is an incredible skill which she displays in multiple works, whether it's in [Zombie & Mummy's](https://www.zombie-and-mummy.org) flash game grime, the film noir sadness of [My boyfriend came home from the war. After dinner they left us alone.](http://www.teleportacia.org/war/) or the sci-fi thriller that is [Agatha Appears](https://pad.profolia.org/agatha). All of her works that I have so far seen have a human soul that beats through, and sure it's great to have a theoritical ideology or agenda going on behind it but what I appreciate the most about these works and this artist is that she makes cool art that really isn't like anything I've seen before. And what I think is the most incredible thing about it is that after a month of so of training on p5.js and VS Code, I feel like I could be able to aspire to make work like her or going in the same direction of her works. It is creative, it is DIY, it is person to person connection on the internet. It is both interactive and storytelling and this is essential because to me with out one or the other the fun gets lost. The love for point and click video games comes from the natural human urge that is curiousity, this is present in Olia's work and it pushes forward the urge to explore the digitally created space. A narritive, an idea, these are things that people care about in all media, it's simple as that, and to me what's pretty incredible about these works is that they're floated around on the internet still, able to be viewed by [different audiences](https://www.frieze.com/article/olia-lialinas-web-based-narrative-parable-digital-development). Why I love this is plain and simple, this was made by a person about people, sure the medium is one not yet properly treaded(and that's a full discussion in itself) but it doesn't take away from the inventiveness. I do think that it's so creative because in the 1990s computers hadn't been adopted fully into society, specifically the personal lives of people. And I think the arms race between Apple/Microsoft/etc to familliarize the world to the internet, said internet was the wild west, societies hadn't yet developed, social tribalisation was the norm, and at the time, the computer was seen as a tool (and society nowadays should remind themselves of that) but this shows it as capable of developing human art. Also to add, the way Olia discusses the web as a tool for art is really interesting because it feels relevant to how society, online communities, and [artist expression online](https://www.guggenheim.org/articles/author/olia-lialina) has evolved over time. It is really refreshing to see some sort of artistic interpretation or analysis on the online world because I feel like that's a new thing or at least something that hasn't been popularly discussed and explored yet.
