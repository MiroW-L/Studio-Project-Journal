Okay so I think for theme I want to do interactivity because I love the idea of a user interfacing with some sort of grand gesture of art. And in the context of what I want I think that art will be something like either a point and click game or a choose your adventure type of game. I'm to read soem of the online reading on interactivity and I'll browse the artists given to find one that will apply into my vision. What inspired this decision was seeing what other users had made in the Workshop task, specifically my classmates [Alice Lee](https://github.com/glovving/workshop-task-4) and [Sienna](https://github.com/siennabienna/workshop_4) and how they had interactive, reactionary little worlds, that really captivated me.

I am feeling quite down after seeing my grade for the workshops assignment, I am feeling a lot of emotions. I know that what I submitted wasn't the best work I could do, however I am sad that it didn't do very well as I was proud of myself for finishing it. I am grateful for Leo's feedback and I will be taking what he said on board. It might be worth looking into support for students with ADHD so I can both meet deadlines and also give a great effort into my working. I want to do better than this, because I want my grades to reflect the effort I put into this work.

> "The level of engagement with documentation is not consistent throughout the workshop tasks (some are more complete than others),and at times there was scope to draw on the full range of resources available to you (e.g. using RiTa's documentation for workshop 6, as well as or instead of DeepSeek). While it's good to see that you're finding DeepSeek helpful in providing solutions, as outlined on the assignment brief and in class, you need to provide full details of your engagement with this tool, including what you've learnt from the answers you've received. The README files made good use of headings, lists, links, and images. For the studio project, make sure to explain what you've learnt from generative AI tools if you use them, and try to use in-links and code extracts with syntax highlighting (see the example workshop 2 repository on the course GitHub account)".

This is Leo's feedback which I will be using as guidance for what improvements I can make for my documentation of my coding work. It's going to be helpful because I kniw what is going to give me bette odds at both getting a higher grade and making something that I feel proud of.

Remember to use [this](https://github.com/Elam-Fine-Arts-205/workshop-task-2-example) when I record code. Also use [Github Basic Writing](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code) and [p.5js Tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/)

### Moving On
What I am going to do today to get started on this first week of work is read the book on interactivity and write that refleaction out today. Then afterwards I will coem back here and say what ideas it inspired within me and then might start a plan for what direction my coding will will go in.

### Quotes from the chapter Interactive Art from the book [A Companion to Digital Art by Nathaniel Stern](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/9781118475249.ch13)
> "The interactivity of software‐based digital systems, on the other hand, is pre‐programmed. With few exceptions, it is a back and forth: “I do this and that happens.” There is a danger that we, as participants, are instrumentalized as interactors, and thus become less dynamic, rather than more so. Interaction becomes a game with a goal, and we must behave in a specific way to win it. Poorly conceived interactive art can force particular and thus predictive movements, which then may as well be static because our moving‐thinking‐feelings are pre‐formed".
