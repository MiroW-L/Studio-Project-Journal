Okay so I think for theme I want to do interactivity because I love the idea of a user interfacing with some sort of grand gesture of art. And in the context of what I want I think that art will be something like either a point and click game or a choose your adventure type of game. I'm to read soem of the online reading on interactivity and I'll browse the artists given to find one that will apply into my vision. What inspired this decision was seeing what other users had made in the Workshop task, specifically Alice Lee (user: glovving) and Sienna (user: siennabienna) and how they had interactive, reactionary little worlds, that really captivated me.
